# N-Puzzle Android Game

In this game, Native Java Android used for implementing N-puzzle game for Android. Tensorflow 2 Keras used for predict hints for solving N-Puzzle and LSTM layer models implemented inside Keras

What is N-Puzzle?
The N-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of N, Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The puzzle also exists in other sizes. If the size is 3×3 tiles, the puzzle is called the 8-puzzle and if 4×4 tiles, the puzzle is called the 15-puzzle named, respectively, for the number of tiles and the number of spaces. The object of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.

What is Tensorflow 2
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.Tensorflow 2 is the advanced version of Tensorflow.

What is Keras?
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code.

What is LSTM?
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video).
